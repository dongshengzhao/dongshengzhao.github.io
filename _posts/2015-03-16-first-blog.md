## Purpose of this blog
> The main reason that I want to set up this blog is to help me study machine learning and do research in this area. I believe that it is a very good habit to rethink and write my own interpretation of what I have learned.

> Because of non-cs background, I think it is also an opportunity to learn something in CS new such as front-end technologies. 

## Logic behind every post
> Most posts will discuss machine algorithms, of course, there are many good books and tutorial introducing these. However, what I want to do is not just introduce the alogrithms, instead I assume that one algorithm had not been invented by predecessors, would we come up with the algorithm? 
>
> I think this kind of assumption could be very helpful to study and do research. The emphasis is about how the algorithm was invented, not just the algorithm itself. It is like "supervised learning" because the result of algorithm in fact is known to us, so we can use the result supervise us to learn one algorithm and we can often ask ourselves why I can't come up with this amazing solution.

The writer is a PhD student with a totally Chinese teaching background, but studying in an English culture University. In order to doing reearch in GNSS, the first step is to know the academic words in this discipline.Therefore, the aim of this blog is trying to make a summary of the common used academical words and give out the translation of these words (into Chinese). Basically, it will contain two tables, one for words aollection and the other for abbreviation. Besides that, some necessary explanation of these words will also be provided. 

**TABLE 1: Academic words**
$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline **Words** & P(X = i) \T & jikjk\\\hline
  1  & 1/6 \\\hline
  2 \T & 1/6 \\\hline
  3 \T & 1/6fahe \\\hline
  4 \T & 1/6 \\\hline
  5 \T & 1/6 \\\hline
  6 \T & 1/6 \\\hline
\end{array}
$$


$$\sum_1^{i=100} x_i \sqrt[6]{ab} $$

title: Life in Horizon, CDT
description: "This is used as a recording of the life in CDT. Mainly, the modules I had in the first year are described with both the introduction and the final submissions. THese modules are very different from what I used to have and very interesting. This is the reason why I would like to share here, to let you have a brief understanding of what the module is like in UK."

This module runs as a series of four 'topic' sessions, which are healthcare, infrastructure (this covers transport and cities), creative, home, accompanied by an activity to develop videos of utopian and dystopian views of the future. All students should submit a short response indicating their preferences for the different group video development topics.  $$ ^{[1]} $$

From my own perspective, the aim of this module is to develop a sense of interdisciplinary and open-minded. The former two videos are made my my team and the last video is the one I took part in. In my own team, we are trying to develop a smart, advanced element, which may help people to organized their life in the future, such as sending and receiving emails, booking cars, giving suggestions about what to eat in dinner, giving health monitoring. Overall, it can help you to make your life easier and more convenient.

<p id="para1">Enabling Technologies</p>
The goal of this module is to provide a broad appreciation of the enabling technologies that underpin digital identity and personal data:
- Sensitise you to design approaches and research issues 
- Develop your skills in analysing potential digital identity solutions across a variety of sectors
- Give you tasters of hands-on experience with key technologies
- Hear from industry and other external perspectives
- Establish a common language
- Develop a set of case studies

The assessment of this module asked to produce a ‘technology watch’ briefing for a different sector of the Digital Economy by developing a website based on Wordpress. This means preparing a high-level briefing that covers:
- Identification and a brief review of emerging DE technologies that are particularly relevant to this sector along with an explanation of why they are relevant;
- An analysis of the opportunities presented by these technologies for creating new applications and services in this sector.
- An analysis of the challenges raised by these emerging technologies;
- Recommendations for how these technologies might be configured and combined into end-to-end architecture for capturing, storing, interpreting and enabling users to interact with personal data.
- Recommendations as to specific research activities that need to be carried out as a result of this. $$^{[2]}$$

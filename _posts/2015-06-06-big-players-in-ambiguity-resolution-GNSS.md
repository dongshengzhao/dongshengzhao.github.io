>Here is an explanation of the reason why I write this blog. This blog is mainly for academical perpose. However it is not only for academic only. I would like to consider it as a recording of my life, currently mainly for my PhD. In this blog, you can find useful research support for GNSS, as well as interesting personal experience. Hope everyone enjoy.
